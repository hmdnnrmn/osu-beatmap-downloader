# osu! Beatmap Downloader (aka my sanity preserver)

this majestic Windows beast sits in the background, silently watching your clipboard like a concerned parent, and the moment you copy a beatmap URL, it goes: 
‚Äúyoink üëÄ‚Äù
downloads it, slaps it into osu!, and life proceeds without lag-induced depression.

---

## Features that slap harder than a 10 map on DT*
- Clipboard psychic powers (copies a URL? it knows)
- Uses `catboy.best` API because official servers said ‚Äúno‚Äù
- Manual paste mode for when you wanna feel like a hacker
- Dark/Light mode toggle for your fragile gamer eyes
- Keeps track of your beatmap history like a nosy ex
- Lets you pick your own download folder because you‚Äôre in control king/queen
- GUI so clean it‚Äôll make you wanna cry

---

## You‚Äôll need:
- A Windows PC that isn‚Äôt on life support
- Python 3.6+ (don‚Äôt be ancient)
- `pyperclip`, `requests`, `tkinter` (aka the holy trinity of code that works)

---

## How to install before you uninstall osu! from frustration:
1. Install some spicy packages:
   ```
   pip install pyperclip requests
   ```

2. Save the code as like... `osu_beatmap_downloader.py` or `god_saver.py` or whatever

3. Run the code in your terminal like a pro:
   ```
   python osu_beatmap_downloader.py
   ```

---

## How to use (brain-dead simple):
1. Launch the app
2. Copy a beatmap URL like (`https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/69420`)
3. App goes full FBI mode, grabs the map, opens it in osu!
4. Or paste it manually if you‚Äôre feeling retro

---

## Bonus content for real ones:
- **History Tab**: so you can relive your best (and worst) decisions
- **Open in Browser**: Open beatmap in browser like it‚Äôs 2010
- **Customizable Download Folder**: Choose your own download folder (treat yourself)
- **Automatic File Opening**: Maps open instantly in osu! so you can suffer to new music immediately

---

## If it breaks (because life is pain):
- Are you online? like... for real?
- Did you paste an actual osu! URL or just a dream?
- Permissions? Admin mode? Ritual sacrifice?
- If nothing works, check if osu! even knows what a .osz file is anymore

this isn‚Äôt just a code. it‚Äôs a revolution.
download maps faster. suffer better.
you deserve it.
